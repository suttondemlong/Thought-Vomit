        Thought Vomit is a tool for getting started in the creative process.
        Itâ€™s like a blind contour/free-association/stream of consciousness journal.
        Use it to vent after a frustrating day and then delete the text without saving it.
        Or pontificate and wax poetic in a flow state without worrying about typos or grammar.
        If you feel you wrote something worthwhile, save it and polish it up later.
